This is a modern personal project showcase website, featuring both Chinese and English language support and responsive design. The project is built with React and Tailwind CSS (v3.4). To speed up development, I used Cursor AI to help write a large portion of the code, while I was primarily responsible for product design and reviewing the project architecture.

I managed the project using **Git Flow**. The repository includes two main branches:
- `main`: Used only for stable, releasable code.
- `dev`: The main branch for daily development; all new features are branched from here.

There are also several supporting branch types:
- `feature/*`: For developing new features, which are merged back into `dev` once completed.
- `release/*`: Used for preparing releases, mainly for testing and bug fixes, and merged back into both `main` and `dev`.
- `hotfix/*`: For urgent fixes on the live version, branched from `main`, and merged back into both `main` and `dev` after resolution.

In practice, the process wasnâ€™t always strictly followed (sometimes for simplicity or convenience), but I intend to adhere more closely to these standards in future development.
